(1) Header
a. It takes up too much height. On KeyOne it takes up more than 9% (including status bar even 13%) of screen real estate.
b. The background pattern/image looks childish. It should be just unicoloured.
(2) Bottom bar
a. Takes up too much height as well (7.5% of screen real estate on K1). With the physical keyboard shortcuts on K1&2 you don't even need those buttons necessarily. For devices that have a limited screen height already due to the physical keyboard, the bottom bar is not an efficient solution.
b. The bottom bar is hidden when you scroll down on the touchscreen but not when using the capacitive keyboard gesture or space key to do so.
(3) Hamburger Navigation Menu
a. That image takes about 17% (including status bar even 21%) of the screen height on K1 without fulfilling any purpose. In fact it can cause an overflow (depending also on the number of accounts) so you need to scroll in the menu. 

This applies to all BB Hub Suite apps that are part of the 2.x update!",9,,10,,NA,,10,

In dark mode I wish the colors were better though, the monthly calendar grid lines are ugly and an eye sore when trying to focus on the monthly calendar of events. They are just too vivid and aren't as appealing as the light mode is.",9,"I am most happy with the changes to BlackBerry contacts. The dark mode is still not a great great color scheme but it's less harsh than the calendar. I still think the contact cards could be smoothed out (refined?) And more compact. Like use the message icon or directions icons (or other integrated messaging icons) and business icons to tab through additional information past the name and phone number, instead of having to both scroll down and selecting the down arrow for more in formation.

I also don't prefer the recent messages showing up on the contacts before the rest of the contact information, I would like it at the end because most of the time that is just nice information to have but not really ever the main reason i am checking out a contact card.

The picture icon also really should be way smaller, it doesn't have to be so big especially with business contacts because I am not adding images for those so it's a lot of wasted space. It can be a small square or circle image which would look a lot nicer than nearly half the screen being wasted. Or maybe do the left side as the name, two lines for first and last and then the right side be the image, sometimes the overlay of the name on the picture can be annoying.",NA,"I love the new design, unfortunately I cannot use this app until it supports active sync with Google in some way, or it's own active sync system or a way to manually back up on my own to save to google drive or dropbox; and can be accessed via a desktop (like the BBM for desktop you are currently working on, YES PLEASE) ",10,"I love the new design, unfortunately I cannot use this app until it supports active sync with Google in some way, or it's own active sync system or a way to manually back up on my own to save to google drive or dropbox; and can be accessed via a desktop (like the BBM for desktop you are currently working on, YES PLEASE) "

Sometimes the bbm messages (private messages) will not be shown in hub. There is a normal notification from android software, that I have a new message and when scrolling down from the top the message is shown. But there is no star beside the hub icon and when opening the hub it shows the last read message from the private chat. After opening the bbm message, hub updates and all is ok. But there is no new message shown. 

In Group chats hub tells me that there is a new message, but it will not show the text of the message but only a point. When I open the message, bbm starts and hub updates with the text. 

The problem is, that this is not a persistent problem. Sometimes it works well and sometimes not...I was not able to find steps to reproduce this error...but it is there. ",9,All is OK at the moment. ,9,,10,,10,Dont use notes

Peter M.,peter.a.mead@gmail.com,1/8/2019 5:57:50 PM,6,"I still think: Hub needs a way to (a) save custom alert settings and (b) reorder custom alert rules.   I'm also having some trouble with Hub on Oreo 8.1-Key2 (but not on Nougat - KeyOne) where one account seems to re-load and re-trigger a whole slew of emails from a particular account (i.e. seems to either get 14 or so messages at once or re-notifies about a large number of messages (received over the last 13 or so hours) all at once.
Also, my dream would be to have a BB10-like feature where there are notification profiles - so that one can select how (i.e. sound, led, vibrate, etc) per rule per notification profile (so can select a subset of notifications to occur when under different profiles) - but this might be more or an android-level issue than a hub-level issue.",6,overall style / appearance upgrades are very nice looking,5,,5,,5,
