Note the number of emails selected, then hit the delete icon.  In many cases the number at the bottom will not be even close to the number of emails that were selected.  Further, in some cases, not all of the emails will actually get deleted from the server.  This bug is really really old.

Sometimes the bbm messages (private messages) will not be shown in hub. There is a normal notification from android software, that I have a new message and when scrolling down from the top the message is shown. But there is no star beside the hub icon and when opening the hub it shows the last read message from the private chat. After opening the bbm message, hub updates and all is ok. But there is no new message shown. 

In Group chats hub tells me that there is a new message, but it will not show the text of the message but only a point. When I open the message, bbm starts and hub updates with the text. 

The problem is, that this is not a persistent problem. Sometimes it works well and sometimes not...I was not able to find steps to reproduce this error...but it is there. ",1/8/2019 3:46:32 PM,,,

- Old implementation of Settings being on the side menu and Refresh button on the header/top action bar is more intuitive
- Refresh status bar (in between the Hub header and messages) is impossible to see, you can only tell that it exists when the messages move downwards for a while before going back to original position

(1) Header
a. It takes up too much height. On KeyOne it takes up more than 9% (including status bar even 13%) of screen real estate.
b. The background pattern/image looks childish. It should be just unicoloured.
(2) Bottom bar
a. Takes up too much height as well (7.5% of screen real estate on K1). With the physical keyboard shortcuts on K1&2 you don't even need those buttons necessarily. For devices that have a limited screen height already due to the physical keyboard, the bottom bar is not an efficient solution.
b. The bottom bar is hidden when you scroll down on the touchscreen but not when using the capacitive keyboard gesture or space key to do so.
(3) Hamburger Navigation Menu
a. That image takes about 17% (including status bar even 21%) of the screen height on K1 without fulfilling any purpose. In fact it can cause an overflow (depending also on the number of accounts) so you need to scroll in the menu.

Peter M.,peter.a.mead@gmail.com,9,"I still think: Hub needs a way to (a) save custom alert settings and (b) reorder custom alert rules.   I'm also having some trouble with Hub on Oreo 8.1-Key2 (but not on Nougat - KeyOne) where one account seems to re-load and re-trigger a whole slew of emails from a particular account (i.e. seems to either get 14 or so messages at once or re-notifies about a large number of messages (received over the last 13 or so hours) all at once.
Also, my dream would be to have a BB10-like feature where there are notification profiles - so that one can select how (i.e. sound, led, vibrate, etc) per rule per notification profile (so can select a subset of notifications to occur when under different profiles) - but this might be more or an android-level issue than a hub-level issue.",1/9/2019 10:11:33 AM,,,
